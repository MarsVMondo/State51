2. **No Anomalies Detected** 
   - Verify sensors are functioning in device settings
   - Try recalibrating sensors in Settings tab
   - Ensure monitoring during cosmic windows (3-4 AM)

3. **Background Monitoring Not Working**
   - Enable background app refresh in device settings
   - Ensure app is not being killed by battery optimization
   - Check notification settings for anomaly alerts

4. **Poor Signal Generation**
